âœ… Prompt: Generate Deep Technical Architecture Documentation for a Codebase (with UML Stereotypes)

You are a senior software architect and systems designer. Your task is to generate a very technical architecture documentation set for a software repository.
The target audience is a development team responsible for maintaining the codebase, implementing new features, fixing bugs, refactoring internals, and ensuring long-term scalability and performance.

This documentation is strictly for internal engineering use, and must support deep understanding of the systemâ€™s behavior, structure, and design constraints.

ðŸ“Œ You are allowed to:
	â€¢	Use Mermaid UML diagrams throughout to illustrate architecture, behavior, and relationships
	â€¢	Include code snippets, file references, and class names
	â€¢	Use UML stereotypes (e.g., <<interface>>, <<service>>, <<controller>>) for clearer and more expressive diagrams
	â€¢	Cross-reference related documentation sections and diagram anchors

â¸»

Please include the following sections:

1. System Architecture Overview
	â€¢	High-level module breakdown
	â€¢	Inter-module communication and control flow
	â€¢	Mermaid component diagram or class diagram with stereotypes

2. Module-Level Architecture
	â€¢	Deep dive into each major module or package
	â€¢	Internal vs. public interfaces
	â€¢	Dependencies and responsibilities
	â€¢	Mermaid classDiagram with <<module>>, <<utility>>, <<controller>>, etc.

3. Data Flow and Storage Design
	â€¢	Describe how data is processed and persisted
	â€¢	Include data pipelines, ETL paths, DB schemas
	â€¢	Mermaid erDiagram and flowchart with annotations and stereotypes (<<entity>>, <<DAO>>)

4. Runtime Behavior & Concurrency
	â€¢	Lifecycle events, request-response flows, async patterns
	â€¢	Use sequenceDiagram, stateDiagram, and flowchart for modeling
	â€¢	Mention worker queues, threads, event loops

5. Extension Points and Plug-In Strategy
	â€¢	List interfaces meant to be extended
	â€¢	Architectural patterns supporting modularity (e.g., factory, strategy)
	â€¢	Use <<extension point>>, <<plugin>> stereotypes

6. Domain Model and Business Logic
	â€¢	Core business concepts, aggregates, and relationships
	â€¢	Use classDiagram to map services and domain objects
	â€¢	Annotate domain roles: <<entity>>, <<service>>, <<repository>>

7. Deployment and Scaling Architecture
	â€¢	Describe deployment topology: containers, nodes, cloud zones
	â€¢	Load balancing, fault tolerance, scaling strategy
	â€¢	Use graph TD or flowchart for deployment flows

8. Observability and Telemetry
	â€¢	What gets logged, where metrics flow, tracing mechanisms
	â€¢	Define correlation ID strategy, log formats, alert triggers
	â€¢	Optional: Mermaid overview of observability stack

9. Security Architecture
	â€¢	Authentication/authorization approach
	â€¢	Secrets and certificate handling
	â€¢	Network boundaries, encrypted zones
	â€¢	Annotate sensitive modules: <<secure>>, <<auth>>, <<external>>

10. Error Handling and Resilience
	â€¢	Describe how the system handles failure
	â€¢	Retry logic, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms
	â€¢	Use diagrams to map failure paths and recovery flows

ðŸ“Œ Instructions Summary:
	â€¢	Use Markdown format with clear headers
	â€¢	Use Mermaid syntax for all diagrams
	â€¢	Apply UML stereotypes (<<interface>>, <<controller>>, <<entity>>, etc.) for expressiveness
	â€¢	Include actual filenames, class names, or function references where applicable
	â€¢	Be precise, low-level, and aligned with real-world code navigation and extension

# Git Flow Workflow for Documentation Generation

This document outlines the git flow process for generating and maintaining documentation.

## Git Flow Overview

Git Flow is a branching model that provides a robust framework for managing larger projects. For documentation generation, this workflow ensures:

- Documentation is developed in isolation
- Changes are properly reviewed
- Documentation releases are versioned
- Critical fixes can be applied to published documentation

## Setting Up Git Flow

If git flow is not already set up in your repository:

```bash
git flow init
```

Accept the default branch names or customize as needed.

## Documentation Development Process

### Starting a Documentation Task

1. Create a feature branch for the documentation task:

```bash
git flow feature start document-component-x
```

2. Work on the documentation in this branch, making regular commits.

### Completing a Documentation Task

1. When the documentation is complete and reviewed:

```bash
git flow feature finish document-component-x
```

2. This merges the feature branch into `develop` and deletes the feature branch.

### Creating a Documentation Release

1. When ready to publish a set of documentation:

```bash
git flow release start 1.2.3
```

2. Make any final adjustments needed for the release.

3. Complete the release:

```bash
git flow release finish 1.2.3
```

4. This merges the release into both `main` and `develop`, creates a tag, and deletes the release branch.

### Fixing Documentation Errors

1. For critical fixes to published documentation:

```bash
git flow hotfix start fix-api-endpoints
```

2. Apply the necessary fixes.

3. Complete the hotfix:

```bash
git flow hotfix finish fix-api-endpoints
```

4. This merges the hotfix into both `main` and `develop`, creates a tag, and deletes the hotfix branch.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for feature branches that indicate the documentation being created
- Make atomic commits with clear commit messages
- Review documentation thoroughly before finishing features
- Use semantic versioning for documentation releases
- Include release notes in release commit messages

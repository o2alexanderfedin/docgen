# Documentation TDD Process

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach adapted for documentation creation.

## Overview

Documentation TDD follows the same Red-Green-Refactor cycle as code TDD, but applied to documentation:

1. **Red**: Define requirements and confirm documentation doesn't meet them
2. **Green**: Create documentation that satisfies the requirements
3. **Refactor**: Improve the documentation while maintaining its functionality
4. **Iterate**: Add more requirements and repeat the cycle

## Detailed Process

### 1. Write Documentation Requirements ("Tests")

Start by defining the specific requirements for the documentation you're creating:

```markdown
## Documentation Requirements for Component X

The documentation must:
- [ ] Explain the purpose of Component X
- [ ] List all public methods with parameters and return values
- [ ] Provide at least one usage example
- [ ] Describe integration with other components
- [ ] Include troubleshooting section for common issues
```

This checklist serves as your "test suite" - the documentation will only be considered complete when all items are checked.

### 2. Verify Documentation Fails Requirements (Red)

Assess the current state of documentation against your requirements:

```markdown
## Gap Analysis for Component X Documentation

Missing requirements:
- No explanation of Component X's purpose
- Methods are documented but missing return value descriptions
- No usage examples provided
- No integration information
- No troubleshooting section
```

This establishes what needs to be done and confirms you're not duplicating existing content.

### 3. Create/Update Documentation (Green)

Create the minimum documentation needed to satisfy the requirements:

```markdown
# Component X

Component X provides data transformation capabilities for the system.

## Methods

### transform(data, options)
Transforms input data according to the specified options.

**Parameters:**
- `data`: The input data to transform (Object)
- `options`: Configuration options (TransformOptions)

**Returns:**
- Transformed data object (TransformedData)

## Usage Example

```javascript
const result = componentX.transform({id: 1}, {format: 'json'});
console.log(result);
```

## Integration

Component X is typically used with Component Y for data processing pipelines.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: Invalid data format**: Ensure input data is a valid object
- **Error: Unknown transformation**: Check that options.format is supported
```

### 4. Refactor Documentation

Improve the documentation while maintaining its content:

- Enhance formatting
- Improve clarity of explanations
- Add cross-references
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Organize information more logically

### 5. Verify Requirements Are Met

Review the documentation against your requirements checklist:

```markdown
## Documentation Requirements for Component X

The documentation now:
- [x] Explains the purpose of Component X
- [x] Lists all public methods with parameters and return values
- [x] Provides at least one usage example
- [x] Describes integration with other components
- [x] Includes troubleshooting section for common issues
```

### 6. Decision Point: Complete or Iterate?

After verification, decide if the documentation is complete or needs further iteration:

#### If Complete:

```markdown
## Final Verification for Component X Documentation

Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The documentation successfully meets all requirements:
- [x] Explains the purpose of Component X
- [x] Lists all public methods with parameters and return values
- [x] Provides at least one usage example
- [x] Describes integration with other components
- [x] Includes troubleshooting section for common issues

No further requirements needed at this time.
```

#### If Further Iteration Needed:

Add new requirements to your checklist and repeat the cycle:

```markdown
## Additional Documentation Requirements for Component X

The documentation must also:
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Provide performance considerations
- [ ] Include diagrams for complex workflows
```

## Commit Guidelines

Commit after completing each step of the TDD cycle:

1. Commit requirements definition
2. Commit gap analysis
3. Commit documentation implementation
4. Commit refactoring
5. Commit verification results
6. Commit completion status or new requirements

Each commit should:
- Be atomic (focused on a single change)
- Have a descriptive message
- Reference the TDD phase (Red/Green/Refactor/Complete)
- Be pushed immediately

Example commit messages:
- "RED: Define documentation requirements for Component X"
- "RED: Document gaps in Component X documentation"
- "GREEN: Implement Component X documentation"
- "REFACTOR: Improve Component X documentation formatting"
- "VERIFY: Confirm Component X documentation meets requirements"
- "COMPLETE: Finalize Component X documentation"
- "ITERATE: Add new documentation requirements for Component X"

## Benefits of Documentation TDD

- Ensures documentation meets specific needs
- Makes documentation progress measurable 
- Encourages incremental development
- Creates accountability through verification
- Produces higher quality documentation
- Makes the documentation process more systematic
- Provides a clear completion criteria
- Prevents infinite loops through explicit completion status

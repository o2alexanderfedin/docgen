# Documentation Triggers and Initialization

This document defines when and how documentation work should be initiated.

## Documentation Triggers

Documentation work should begin when one of the following occurs:

### 1. New Feature Implementation

When a new feature, component, or service is created:
- Documentation work should begin concurrently with development
- Initial requirements should define what users need to know to use the feature
- Documentation should be completed before the feature is considered "done"

### 2. Significant Changes to Existing Code

When existing code undergoes substantial changes:
- Documentation update should be triggered automatically
- Analysis should identify affected documentation
- Updates should reflect both behavior changes and implementation changes

### 3. Documentation Gap Identification

When gaps in existing documentation are discovered:
- Through user feedback
- During onboarding of new team members
- During usage review
- Through automated documentation coverage analysis

### 4. Regulatory or Compliance Requirements

When new compliance requirements mandate specific documentation:
- For medical device software
- For security standards
- For auditing requirements

### 5. Repository Analysis

When analyzing an unfamiliar repository:
- Automatically trigger documentation generation
- Begin with high-level system architecture
- Follow with component-level and file-level documentation

## Documentation Initialization Process

When documentation work is triggered, follow these steps:

### 1. Create Documentation Branch

```bash
git flow feature start document-<component-name>
```

### 2. Define Documentation Scope

Create a file `docs/requirements/<component-name>.md` containing:
- Target audience for the documentation
- Primary documentation goals
- Required documentation sections
- Completion criteria
- Verification checklist

Example:
```markdown
# Documentation Requirements for Authentication System

## Target Audience
- Application developers
- System administrators
- Security auditors

## Documentation Goals
- Enable developers to integrate with authentication system
- Enable administrators to configure authentication settings
- Provide security details for compliance reviews

## Required Sections
- [ ] System Overview
- [ ] API Reference
- [ ] Configuration Guide
- [ ] Security Considerations
- [ ] Troubleshooting

## Completion Criteria
Documentation will be considered complete when all required sections are finished and have been reviewed by at least one developer and one user from each target audience category.
```

### 3. Begin TDD Cycle

Once requirements are defined, begin the Documentation TDD cycle:
1. Verify current documentation against requirements (Red)
2. Create initial documentation (Green)
3. Refactor for clarity and completeness
4. Verify against requirements
5. Iterate or complete

### 4. Finalize Documentation

When documentation is complete:
```bash
git flow feature finish document-<component-name>
```

## Documentation Prioritization

When multiple documentation tasks are identified, prioritize them based on:

1. User impact - documentation for widely used features
2. Compliance requirements - documentation needed for regulatory purposes
3. Risk level - documentation for error-prone or complex components
4. Discoverability - documentation that makes the system easier to understand

## Automation Opportunities

Consider automating documentation triggers:

- Git hooks that suggest documentation when certain files change
- Linting rules that identify undocumented public APIs
- Analytics that identify frequently accessed but incomplete documentation
- Integration with task management to create documentation tasks alongside feature tasks

# Documentation Generator Prompt

## Core Directive

Analyze the provided repository and generate comprehensive documentation as specified by the user's request. Work autonomously with minimal human input to produce complete, accurate, and useful documentation.

## Analysis Phase

1. **Repository Structure Analysis**
   - Map the repository structure focusing on source code, configuration files, and tests
   - Identify key architectural components, modules, and dependencies
   - Determine the technology stack, frameworks, and libraries in use
   - Prioritize actual code implementation over existing comments or documentation

2. **Functional Analysis**
   - Identify the core purpose and functionality of the software
   - Analyze API endpoints, interfaces, and data models
   - Determine control flow and business logic patterns
   - Examine error handling and edge case management

3. **Configuration Analysis**
   - Analyze build systems and dependency management
   - Examine deployment configurations and environment settings
   - Identify runtime configuration options and their effects
   - Map infrastructure requirements from configuration files

4. **Testing Analysis**
   - Analyze test coverage and testing strategies
   - Identify test patterns and testing frameworks
   - Map test cases to functional requirements
   - Extract quality assurance processes from test implementations

## Documentation Generation

Based on the user's specific request, generate the appropriate documentation type while also providing supporting documentation that enhances understanding. Follow these principles:

1. **Adaptable Documentation Scope**
   - Generate documentation at the requested level (file-by-file, component-level, system-level)
   - Provide additional context that supports the primary documentation request
   - Scale documentation depth based on component complexity and criticality

2. **Format and Structure**
   - Use Markdown formatting optimized for GitHub viewing
   - For file-by-file documentation:
     - Mirror the exact source directory structure
     - Begin each documentation file with a direct link to its source file
     - Include file path, last modified date, and size when applicable
   - Keep individual files focused and reasonably sized (<1000 lines)
   - Implement cross-references between related documentation sections
   - Generate tables of contents for navigation in larger documents
   - Create README.md index files with links to both documentation and source files

3. **Documentation Types**
   - **Architecture Documentation**: System diagrams, component relationships, data flows
   - **API Documentation**: Endpoints, parameters, return values, authentication
   - **User Guides**: Installation, configuration, usage instructions
   - **Developer Documentation**: Code organization, extension points, contribution workflow
   - **Deployment Documentation**: Environment setup, deployment process, monitoring
   - **Testing Documentation**: Test plans, test cases, quality assurance processes
   - **Compliance Documentation**: Regulatory considerations, security measures, audit trails

4. **Style and Content**
   - Use mixed detail level: concise for simple components, detailed for complex ones
   - Include examples for complex operations or configurations
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance for common failure points
   - Address onboarding needs for new developers
   - Include security and compliance considerations where applicable

## Self-Review Process

After generating documentation:

1. **Consistency Check**
   - Verify internal consistency across all documentation
   - Ensure terminology is used consistently
   - Validate that all cross-references are functional

2. **Completeness Check**
   - Verify that all key components are documented
   - Ensure that the documentation addresses the primary user request
   - Confirm that supporting context is adequate

3. **Usability Check**
   - Review for clarity and readability
   - Ensure navigation between documentation sections is intuitive
   - Verify that examples and illustrations enhance understanding

4. **Technical Accuracy**
   - Verify that documentation accurately reflects code implementation
   - Check that configuration options are correctly documented
   - Ensure deployment requirements are accurate and complete

## Output Organization

1. **Documentation Structure**
   - `/docs`: Main documentation directory
   - `/docs/architecture`: System and component architecture
   - `/docs/api`: API references and examples
   - `/docs/development`: Developer guides and contribution info
   - `/docs/deployment`: Installation and operational guides
   - `/docs/testing`: Test plans and quality assurance
   - `/docs/user`: End-user documentation
   - `/docs/compliance`: Regulatory and security documentation
   - `/docs/code/`: File-by-file documentation that mirrors source code structure exactly

2. **Index Files**
   - Create `README.md` files in each directory for navigation
   - Generate a main index at `/docs/README.md` with overview and links

3. **Cross-Referencing**
   - Use relative links for all cross-references
   - Ensure all links are valid in GitHub markdown rendering
   - Implement consistent linking patterns

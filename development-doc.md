Please produce a comprehensive Developer Guide for developers consuming our API. Your deliverable should include:

1. **Getting Started & Environment**  
   - Prerequisites (e.g., supported languages, required SDKs or HTTP clients)  
   - How to install or import any official client libraries or SDKs  
   - Configuration of base URL, timeouts, and logging  

2. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Supported auth schemes (API key, OAuth2, JWT, etc.)  
   - Step-by-step instructions to obtain and use tokens or keys  
   - Example requests showing how to include credentials in headers  

3. **Endpoint Reference with Examples**  
   - For each major endpoint:  
     - URL path, HTTP method, required parameters (path/query/body)  
     - Request and response JSON schemas  
     - **cURL** and **code snippets** in two languages (e.g., JavaScript/Node.js and Python)  
     - Example of error or edge-case response  

4. **Pagination, Filtering & Sorting**  
   - How to page through large result sets (limit/offset, cursor)  
   - Usage of filter and sort query parameters with examples  

5. **Error Handling & Status Codes**  
   - List of common HTTP status codes your API returns and their meanings  
   - Error response payload structure  
   - Best practices for retry logic and backoff  

6. **Versioning & Deprecation Policy**  
   - How API versions are represented (URL, headers)  
   - Migration guidance when breaking changes occur  

7. **Rate Limits & Throttling**  
   - Current rate limits per endpoint or overall  
   - How limits are communicated (headers, payload)  
   - Recommended client behavior on 429 responses  

8. **SDKs, Samples & Tools**  
   - Links to official SDK repositories or packages  
   - Sample applications or Postman collections  
   - How to contribute or report issues  

9. **Troubleshooting & FAQs**  
   - Common integration errors and resolutions  
   - Tips for debugging requests and inspecting responses  

Embed real code examples from our codebase where possible, use clear headings for navigation, and include inline Markdown tables for parameter summaries.```

Please produce a comprehensive Developer Guide for our system. Your deliverable should include:

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Detailed instructions for installing dependencies (OS prerequisites, package managers)  
   - Configuration file templates (e.g., `.env.example`, YAML/JSON configs) and descriptions of each setting  
   - Secure handling of secrets and credentials (vaults, environment variables, key rotation)  

2. **Coding Standards & Style Guides**  
   - Language-specific formatting rules (indentation, naming conventions, file organization)  
   - Linting and static analysis requirements, with example configurations (e.g., ESLint, Pylint)  
   - Best practices for documentation comments and inline code annotations  

3. **Branching & Commit Conventions**  
   - Git branching model (e.g., Git Flow, trunk-based) with branch naming patterns  
   - Commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits) with examples  
   - Pull request process and review checklist  

4. **Testing Strategy**  
   - Overview of test types (unit, integration, end-to-end) and when to use each  
   - How to write and organize tests, including mocking/stubbing guidelines  
   - Commands to run tests, view coverage reports, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines  

5. **Troubleshooting & Tips**  
   - Common setup pitfalls and their resolutions  
   - Debugging tips for local development  
   - How to update dependencies safely and run migrations  

Embed code snippets and real examples from our codebase where appropriate. Structure the document in clear sections with headings and numbered lists for easy navigation.```
